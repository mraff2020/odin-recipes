    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, grated</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs (panko recommended)</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>small amount of olive oil for brushing</li>
        <li>grill seasoning (optional)</li>
        <li>1 green onion, diced</li>
        <li>A pinch of grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken or beef broth</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 cubes of brown curry mix</li>
        <li>small amount of browning sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the ground beef together with the onion, 1/2 of the garlic, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Form into 4 small patty shapes.</li>
        <li>Brush the patties with olive oil. Grill seasoning can be added to help form a crust later on.</li>
        <li>Combine the rest of the grated garlic with the green onion and ginger in a seperate bowl. This will help season the curry sauce.</li>
        <li>In a medium frying pan, brown the patties over medium-high heat, cooking for about 4 minutes on each side. Alternately, you can use a grill pan to get those grill marks like in the game.</li>
        <li>In a small sauce pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the green onion and ginger and brown for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the broth and curry cubes. Stir occasionally as the cubes melt. Heat to a boil, and continue stirring periodically until the curry thickens.</li>
        <li>To plate, place the patties into a pool of curry. Some of it can be spooned on top. Serve with your favorite rice (or whatever you like to eat curry with!)</li>
    </ol>
